# Ben Walker, baw3hg

# My game will be a top down puzzle game where the user
# needs to push certain boxes to certain locations in order to win,
# much like the game Sokoban.

# The optional features will be Animation by having the user character
# have animated movement. There will also be a Timer giving the user
# a certain amount of time to complete the level in order to win.
# There will also be levels in order to progress throughout the game.
# For the last optional feature, I am thinking I will have either save points
# at the start of each level, or having collectibles that would give the
# user extra time to complete the level.
